# wPerf: Generic Off-CPU Analysis to Identify Bottleneck Waiting Events

## Notice

**This repo has been deprecated and will be reimplemented using eBPF. New repo will be updated later.**

## Intro

wPerf is designed to identify bottlenecks caused by all kinds of waiting events.
To identify waiting events that limit the applicationâ€™s throughput, wPerf uses
cascaded re-distribution to compute the local impact of a waiting event and uses
wait-for graph to compute whether such impact can reach other threads.

Check the paper for more details: [wPerf: Generic Off-CPU Analysis to Identify Bottleneck Waiting Events](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/osdi18-zhou.pdf), OSDI 2018.

## Requirements
- [Kernel](http://www.kernel.org/): Only tested on [CentOS Linux release 7.5.1804](https://www.centos.org)
  Please make sure the KProbe and CONFIG_SCHEDSTATS features are enabled.
- [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv) Tested with v1.x

## Deploy

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ethercflow/wPerf
cd wPerf
./deploy.sh
```
## Tracing

Example: The target pid is 1234, which has three worker threads A,B,C,
default the output dir is /tmp/wperf, record period is 90s.

Run

``` shell
cd bin
sudo ./recorder.py -T A,B,C -p 1234
./encorder.py -i /tmp/wperf/softirq/output -o softirq
./encorder.py -i /tmp/wperf/switch/output -o switch
cp -a /tmp/wperf/cpufreq .
cp -a /tmp/wperf/pidlist .
./analyzer -cpufreq=cpufreq -pids=pidlist -switch=switch -softirq=softirq
```

After analyzer, you can get a waitfor file, open it to see if there is a knot.
In the future, I'll graphs the results. Currently, you can update waitfor to
[online graph explorer](https://osusyslab.github.io/wperf/) with your result
file and check out the bottleneck in that knot. (You'd better filter kworker
info before upload)
